#Article.create(title: "Is there someone who can watch us?", author: "Matt Healy", body: "I used to have a reoccurring dream when I was younger. The narrative was loosely based, but the setting was always the surrounding areas of where my parents grew up. I think I was slightly obsessed with how certain, bleak areas of Northern England contained my history and the soul of my family, my psyche - I always felt connected and disconnected at the same time. Metaphorically and physically I would visit these places frequently as a youngster and in turn have used them as the setting to a lot of the stories in The 1975 - the North East was the visual setting to my formative years.")
#Article.create(title: "Between the stripes", author: "Leonardo San Miguel", body: 'Pantomime lore dates as far back as the eight century BC, but it was never formalized as an art—the one we know now we know now—until around the sixteenth century in Easter Europe. Although almost every record of Pantomime implies the art was primarily conceived as a form of entertainment, there have always been traces that indicate the art was a manifestation of a grander concept: that of revelation through absence. Indeed, a pantomime’s performance is, however comical or banal, a form of illusionism. As author Edward Lancaster writes in The Mysticism of Performing Arts, “There is no greater demonstration of magic than that of creating entire worlds and realities through the use of nothing but one’s body in motion and the unrelenting desire of the human mind to fill in the blanks.”
